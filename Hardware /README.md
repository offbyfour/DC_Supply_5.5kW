# DC_Supply_5.5kW Hardware 
This is the project page for an open source 5.5kW 12-150VDC Supply (250A Max).    

## Design Architechture

The architecture of this design consists of 5 main blocks with the most complex being the converters. Below is a breakdown of the functions and the features of each.

### Input Interfaces
The input interface is basically how the supply gets connected to the wall. Since there are multiple plugs that can be used, the best solution seems to be something like the Miller MVP System.

#### Features 
- 2m(6.5ft) 30A Cable
- GFCI Protection
- NEMA Plugs
  - 14-30
  - 6-30
  - 5-15
  - 5-20
