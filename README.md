Open Source 5.5kW 12-150VDC Supply (250A Max)


## AC/DC Conversion

The R48-3000e3 supplies have a few characteristics that I think make it nice for this application:
1. Cheap and easy to find  (about $100-$200 but even cheaper in some places)
2. Programmable output voltage (42VDC-58VDC)
3. Hot-pluggable and Stackable (for additional power support)
4. Wide input voltage range (85 300VAC) for better flexibility and so that it can work with dirty supplies like generators.

But the main reason I want to use these supplies is because they dont require significant exposure to high voltages which make them a little easier to DIY. Although I understand the drawback that this is probably not the most efficient way to supply the circuit.

For this design, I'm thinking 2 paralleled supplies should be good enough to meet the circuit requirements.
